FundVal Live v1.3.2 (2026-02-12)

Added
- HK symbol normalization across search/strategy flows (HK3441 / 3441.HK -> 03441).
- Free HK data fallback pipeline:
  - Real-time quote from Sina HK feed.
  - Daily history from AkShare stock_hk_daily.
  - Yahoo chart API fallback for HK history.
- In-batch rebalance refresh API (refresh current batch in-place, no new batch creation).

Changed
- Strategy update flow now defaults auto-rebalance lot_size to 100 to avoid odd-lot fractional ETF suggestions.
- OCR holdings import in strategy update mode now replaces target holdings instead of appending.
- Rebalance batch/detail time rendering now displays Beijing time (Asia/Shanghai).

Fixed
- Watchlist add ambiguity for HK symbols (03441 no longer shadowed by 003441 fuzzy hit).
- Duplicate submission on strategy create/update and smart rebalance actions (loading guards + disabled buttons).
- "Refresh calculation" moved to batch detail, now refreshes current batch only.
- Refresh endpoint compatibility fallback in frontend (POST /refresh -> PATCH /refresh -> POST /recalc) to reduce 405 issues.
- Reduced chart width/height warning probability by adding minimum dimensions.
